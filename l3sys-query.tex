\section{Introduction}

\TeX{} engines provide only very limited access to information about the system
they are used on: using primitives, one can for example get the size of a single
file, but not a list of files in a given location. For most documents, this is
not an issue as they are self-contained. However, for cases where
\enquote{dynamic} construction of parts of a document is needed based on file
lists or other system-dependent data, methods to obtain this from (restricted)
shell escape are desirable.

Security considerations mean that directly querying the system shell is
problematic for general use. Instead, \emph{restricted} shell escape may be used
to get many details, provided a suitable tool is available to provide the
information in a platform-neutral and security-conscious way. The Java program
\texttt{texosquery}, written by Nicola Talbot, has been available for a number
of years to provide this facility. As well as file system insight,
\texttt{texosquery} also provides for example locale data and other system
information. However, the requirement for Java means that the script is not
automatically usable when a \TeX{} system is installed.

The \LaTeX{} team have therefore provided a Lua-based script,
\texttt{l3sys-query}, which conforms to the security requirements of \TeX{} Live
using Lua to obtain the system information. This means that it can be used
\enquote{out of the box} across platforms. The facilities provided by
\texttt{l3sys-query} are more limited than \texttt{texosquery}, partly as some
information is available in modern \TeX{} systems using primitives, and partly
as the aim of \texttt{l3sys-query} is to provide information where there are
defined use cases. Requests for additional data interfaces are welcome.

\section{The command line interface}

The command line interface to 
\begin{center}
  \ttfamily
  l3sys-query \meta{cmd} [\meta{option(s)}] [\meta{spec}]
\end{center}
where \texttt{\meta{cmd}} can be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\ttfamily
  \item ls
  \item ls \meta{spec}
  \item pwd
\end{itemize}
The \meta{cmd} are described below. The result of the \meta{cmd} will be
printed to the terminal in an interactive run; in normal usage, this will be
piped to the calling \TeX{} process. Results containing path separators
\emph{always} use~|/|, irrespective of the platform in use.

As well as these targets, the script recognises the options
\begin{itemize}
  \item |--sort| Sets the method used to sort entries returned by |ls|
  \item |--type| Selects the type of entry returned by |ls|
\end{itemize}
The action of these options on the appropriate \meta{cmd(s)} is detailed below.

\subsection{\texttt{ls [\meta{spec}]}}

Lists the contents of one or more directories, in a manner somewhat reminiscent
of the Unix command |ls| or the Windows command |dir|. The exact nature of the
output will depend on the \meta{spec}, is given, along with the prevailing
options.

When no \meta{spec} is given, all entries in the current directory will be
listed, one per line in the output. This will include both files and
subdirectories. The order of results will be determined by the underlying
operating system process: unless requested \emph{via} an option, no sorting
takes place.

As standard, the \meta{spec} is treated as a file glob, for example |*.png|. To
prevent wildcards in such globs from being expanded at the wrong time, they
should always be surround by |'| characters,\footnote{On Windows, the shell does
not expand globs, but \texttt{texlua} does: using \texttt{'} is a
platform-neutral way to avoid any expansion.} for example
\begin{verbatim}
  l3sys-query ls '*.png'
\end{verbatim}

Since \texttt{l3sys-query} is intended primarily for use with restricted shell
escape calls from \TeX{} processes, handling of spaces is unusual. It is not
possible to quote spaces in such a call, so for example whilst
\begin{verbatim}
  l3sys-query ls "'foo *'"
\end{verbatim}
does work from the command prompt to find all files with names starting
\verb*|foo |, it would not work \emph{via} restricted shell escape. To
circumvent this, \texttt{l3sys-query} will collect all command line arguments
after any \meta{options}, and combine these as a space-separated \meta{spec},
for example allowing
\begin{verbatim}
  l3sys-query ls 'foo *'
\end{verbatim}
to work. Note that the \emph{entire} \meta{spec} should be surrounded by |'|
characters to prevent expansion of the~|*|.

The results returned by |ls| can be sorted using the |--sort| option. This
can be set to |none| (use the order from the file system: the default),
|name| (sort by file name or |date| (sort by date last modified).

The listing can be filtered based on the type of entry using the |--type|
option. This takes a string argument, one of |d| (directory) or |f| (file).

For security reasons, only paths within the current working directory can be
queried, this for example |graphics/*.png| will list all |png| files in the
|graphics| subdirectory, but |../graphics/*.png| will yield no output.

\subsection{\texttt{pwd}}

Returns the present working directory from which \texttt{l3sys-query} is run.
From within a \TeX{} run, this will (usually) be the directory containing the
main file, assuming a command such as
\begin{verbatim}
  pdflatex main.tex
\end{verbatim}
The \texttt{pwd} command is unaffected by any options.

\section{The \LaTeX{} interface}

Using \texttt{l3sys-query} is not tied to access \emph{via} \pkg{expl3}, but
this is the preferred approach for the \LaTeX{} Team. Details of how to use
\texttt{l3sys-query} as an \pkg{expl3} programmer are covered in
\texttt{interface3.pdf}.
